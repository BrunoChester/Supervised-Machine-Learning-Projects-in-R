# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Projects-in-R

1: A dataset on fuel effiency of cars from the United States Department of Energy, and tabulates how much gas new cars use per mile;
Dataset can be found here: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml

2: The annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey where I'll predict whether a developer works remotely or not.

3: A survey on voter attitudes where I will predict voter turnout.

4: A large survey of nuns where I will predict the age of the nuns from their responses on the survey.

Thanks to Julia Silge, who built a free course about supervised machine learning/predictive modeling that you can find here:https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.com/
All ideas from analysis came from her course. Along the way I decided to take my own route and tweak the code or change the analysis according to my curiosity. Feel free to do the same with her code and mine. The more exploration & different insights the better.
