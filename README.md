# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Projects-in-R

1: A dataset on fuel effiency of cars from the United States Department of Energy, and tabulates how much gas new cars use per mile

2: The annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey where I'll predict whether a developer works remotely or not.

3: A survey on voter attitudes where I will predict voter turnout.

4: A large survey of nuns where I will predict the age of the nuns from their responses on the survey.

Thanks to Julia Silge, who built a free course about supervised machine learning/predictive modeling.
